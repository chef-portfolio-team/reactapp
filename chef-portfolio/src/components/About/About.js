                My name is Rordon Gamsay. I grew up in the small town of Sleepy
                Hollow, Wyoming. I used to be a web devoloper for a small company.
                I had a small passion for cooking food, so I started posting my own
                creations on a blogging site. for a year and a half now I have been
                posting on my own site and now I have a big following.
